# My PCBs
This repository contains sereveral PCB board that I've design for use in the Formula Student racecar. In addition to PCB designs, the repository also includes 3D models of some of their housings.

## ðŸš¨ Tractive System Active Light (TSAL) module ðŸš¨
According to the Formula Student Rules 2022, the Tractive System Active Light (TSAL) is a safety feature that must be implemented in all electric vehicles participating in the competition. Whole project of the TSAL can be found in this repository, including PCB layout and scheme. 

### Overview
The TSAL must be based on the voltage level of the High Voltage (HV) battery or the voltage level of the motor controller, and it should indicate whether the tractive system is active or not.

The TSAL should be mounted on the rear of the vehicle and must be clearly visible from the rear of the vehicle during both day and night conditions. The light should be red or yellow and must flash at a frequency between 1Hz and 4Hz.

During normal operation, the TSAL should remain on steadily to indicate that the tractive system is active. When the vehicle is in an emergency or shutdown state, the TSAL should flash at a higher frequency between 4Hz and 10Hz to indicate that the tractive system is inactive.

## Ready-to-Run Sound and Autonomous System Status Indicators module
In this repository there is also a project containing a module for ready-to-run-sound and ASSI safety systems.

### ðŸ”Š Ready-to-Run Sound ðŸ”Š
According to the Formula Student Rules 2022, Ready-to-Run Sound (RtRS) is a safety feature that must be implemented in all electric vehicles participating in the competition.

The purpose of the RtRS is to alert pedestrians and other drivers of the presence of an electric vehicle, which can be difficult to hear due to its quiet operation. The sound must be continuous, with a minimum sound pressure level of 55dB(A) and a maximum of 75dB(A) measured at a distance of 2 meters from the vehicle in all directions.

The RtRS must be activated when the vehicle is in Ready-to-Run mode, which means the vehicle is ready to move and all systems are operational. The sound should be automatically turned off when the vehicle is not in Ready-to-Run mode or is turned off.

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous System Status Indicators ðŸ¤–
According to the Formula Student Rules 2022, the Autonomous System Status Indicators (ASSI) module is a safety feature that must be implemented in all autonomous vehicles participating in the competition.

The ASSI module is responsible for providing visual and audible feedback on the status of the autonomous system to the vehicle occupants, other drivers, and pedestrians. The module must be integrated into the vehicle's user interface or dashboard and should display the following information:

+ Autonomous System Status: The module must display the status of the autonomous system, indicating whether it is active or inactive.
+ System Health Status: The module must display the health status of the autonomous system, indicating whether the system is functioning correctly or not.
+ System State: The module must display the current state of the autonomous system, indicating whether the system is in calibration mode, initialization mode, or autonomous driving mode.

In addition to the visual feedback, the ASSI module must also provide audible feedback to alert the vehicle occupants and pedestrians of any critical issues related to the autonomous system. The audible feedback must be distinct and easily identifiable from any other sounds in the vehicle or surrounding environment.
